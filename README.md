### Usage Note
Only relevant if you enable CUDA: You must have a compatible graphics card for the CUDA version you are using.  I am testing with CUDA 10.2 and 11.0.  With CUDA 11, NVIDIA dropped support for Compute Capability: `3.0, 3.5, and 5.2`.
For more information on GPU products and compute capability, see [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).
